# CMake Setup

This is a simple bootstrap project for C++ using [**CMake**](https://cmake.org/download/) and [**doctest**](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)

You can edit the CMakeLists.txt file to set the targeted C++ Standard (Default is C++11) in the variable _CXX_STANDARD_.

### Requirements

- C++ Compiler with possibily support to modern standards (e.g. gcc >= 5, clang >= 3.8, Visual Studio >= 2013)
- CMake

### Unix-Like Setup

To run the project, just open a terminal (on Linux/Mac) and run the following commands:

```
cd /path/to/this/project
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
```

To run the tests just run:

```
make
make test
```

### Windows

If you have Visual Studio, just launch the CMake Gui tool and select the project source folder and a build directory and which version of Visual Studio you want to target.

After pressing the _Generate_ button, you can open the Visual Studio \*.sln file generated in the build directory you have previously selected.

### Docker

If you have Docker installed on your machine (Linux/Mac/Windows with WSL), you can start a docker container by using the script:

`docker_up.sh`

The script will build a docker image with all the requirements (gcc compiler, cmake, make) and will run the docker container with a bash prompt in the `/project` folder.

Once you're done with coding, typing `exit` in the shell will stop and automatically remove the docker container (not the image).

The script `build.sh` contains the steps described in the [Unix-Like Setup](#Unix-Like-Setup)
